1. Considering Canvas platform, write three related requirements with at least one functional requirement and one non-functional requirement. These can represent the current state of Canvas or be things you'd like to see offered by the platform.

- Functional requirement: The system must send a confirmation email when a new user account is created.
- Functional requirement: The system must allow students to have course access corresponding to what they registered.
- Non-functional requirement: The system sends a notification email to students when the instructor added new material.

2. Use Agile methodology to write requirements as user stories. Then, choose one of your stories and suggest at least one Spike that might be needed to implement it. For one story, write some possible acceptance criteria for it.

- As a web app user, I want to be able to log in to my account so that I can see my liked event history.
  - Spike: Implement the system to allow users to log in with their google/email accounts.
  - Spike: Implement the system to allow users to create their own accounts.
- As a user, I want to see all the music events on campus in the following week so that I can attend some of them.
- As a user, I want to see all available scholarships with STEAM majors so that I can apply for some of them.
